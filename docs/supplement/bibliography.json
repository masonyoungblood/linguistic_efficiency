  {"id":"bermudez-cuamatzin_etal23","abstract":"Human activities can be noisy, especially in urban areas, and affect animals detrimentally. Trafﬁc noise may interfere with acoustic communication through masking and may yield noise-dependent modiﬁcation of acoustic signals. Such vocal ﬂexibility in birds has been investigated most often for songs, but rarely for calls, even though calls are typically used more frequently. Here we exposed male House Finches Haemorhous mexicanus from urban areas in Mexico City to low and high levels of anthropogenic noise. We investigated: variation in call type repertoire use among birds caught at localities with different noise levels, call type use in response to experimental noise exposure, and whether there were immediate noise-dependent spectral or temporal adjustments. We found no locality-dependent call repertoires, as males from all sites shared most of their call types. Males in quiet areas called with higher frequency and longer duration than did birds from noisier areas. However, this case study lacked replication of sites, limiting the generality of conclusions that can be drawn. Under experimental noise exposure, we also found no shift in call repertoire use. However, in line with expectations, one of two dominant call types of relatively low frequency showed an increase in peak frequency under experimentally elevated noise conditions, and the birds also produced shorter versions of the two dominant call types in the noisier treatment. In summary, we found no evidence for noise-dependent call repertoire use in our case study but we conﬁrmed experimentally that House Finches are capable of immediate spectral and temporal call adjustments in response to noise level ﬂuctuations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bermúdez‐Cuamatzin","given":"Eira"},{"family":"Slabbekoorn","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Macías Garcia","given":"Constantino"}],"citation-key":"bermudez-cuamatzin_etal23","container-title":"Ibis","container-title-short":"Ibis","DOI":"10.1111/ibi.13161","ISSN":"0019-1019, 1474-919X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"571-586","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spectral and temporal call flexibility of House Finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) from urban areas during experimental noise exposure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.13161","volume":"165"},

  {"id":"caplan_etal20","abstract":"Is language designed for communicative and functional efficiency? G. K. Zipf famously argued that shorter words are more frequent because they are easier to use, thereby resulting in the statistical law that bears his name. Yet, G. A. Miller showed that even a monkey randomly typing at a keyboard, and intermittently striking the space bar, would generate “words” with similar statistical properties. Recent quantitative analyses of human language lexicons (Piantadosi et al., 2012) have revived Zipf's functionalist hypothesis. Ambiguous words tend to be short, frequent, and easy to articulate in language production. Such statistical findings are commonly interpreted as evidence for pressure for efficiency, as the context of language use often provides cues to overcome lexical ambiguity. In this study, we update Miller's monkey thought experiment to incorporate empirically motivated phonological and semantic constraints on the creation of words. We claim that the appearance of communicative efficiency is a spandrel (Gould & Lewontin, 1979), as lexicons formed without the context of language use or reference to communication or efficiency exhibit comparable statistical properties. Furthermore, the updated monkey model provides a good fit for the growth trajectory of English as recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary. Focusing on the history of English words since 1900, we show that lexicons resulting from the monkey model provide a better embodiment of communicative efficiency than the actual lexicon of English. We conclude by arguing for the need to go beyond correlational statistics and to seek direct evidence for the me­ chanisms that underlie principles of language design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Caplan","given":"Spencer"},{"family":"Kodner","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"caplan_etal20","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104466","ISSN":"00100277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"104466","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Miller's monkey updated: communicative efficiency and the statistics of words in natural language","title-short":"Miller's monkey updated","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027720302857","volume":"205"},

It has been argued that the law is not a relevant or useful property of language because simple random texts - constructed by concatenating random characters including blanks behaving as word delimiters - exhibit a Zipf’s lawlike word rank distribution.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: In this article, we examine the flaws of such putative good fits of random texts. We demonstrate - by means of three different statistical tests - that ranks derived from random texts and ranks derived from real texts are statistically inconsistent with the parameters employed to argue for such a good fit, even when the parameters are inferred from the target real text. Our findings are valid for both the simplest random texts composed of equally likely characters as well as more elaborate and realistic versions where character probabilities are borrowed from a real text.\nConclusions/Significance: The good fit of random texts to real Zipf’s law-like rank distributions has not yet been established.

  {"id":"ferrer-i-cancho_etal22","abstract":"The problem of compression in standard information theory consists of assign­ ing codes as short as possible to numbers. Here we consider the problem of optimal coding – under an arbitrary coding scheme – and show that it predicts Zipf’s law of abbreviation, namely a tendency in natural languages for more frequent words to be shorter. We apply this result to investigate optimal coding also under so-called non-singular coding, a scheme where unique segmenta­ tion is not warranted but codes stand for a distinct number. Optimal nonsingular coding predicts that the length of a word should grow approximately as the logarithm of its frequency rank, which is again consistent with Zipf’s law of abbreviation. Optimal non-singular coding in combination with the max­ imum entropy principle also predicts Zipf’s rank-frequency distribution. Furthermore, our findings on optimal non-singular coding challenge common beliefs about random typing. It turns out that random typing is in fact an optimal coding process, in stark contrast with the common assumption that it is detached from cost cutting considerations. Finally, we discuss the implica­ tions of optimal coding for the construction of a compact theory of Zipfian laws more generally as well as other linguistic laws.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrer-i-Cancho","given":"Ramon"},{"family":"Bentz","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Seguin","given":"Caio"}],"citation-key":"ferrer-i-cancho_etal22","container-title":"Journal of Quantitative Linguistics","container-title-short":"Journal of Quantitative Linguistics","DOI":"10.1080/09296174.2020.1778387","ISSN":"0929-6174, 1744-5035","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"165-194","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Optimal coding and the origins of Zipfian laws","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09296174.2020.1778387","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"fitch06","abstract":"Studies of the biology of music (as of language) are highly interdisciplinary and demand the integration of diverse strands of evidence. In this paper, I present a comparative perspective on the biology and evolution of music, stressing the value of comparisons both with human language, and with those animal communication systems traditionally termed \"song\". A comparison of the \"design features\" of music with those of language reveals substantial overlap, along with some important differences. Most of these differences appear to stem from semantic, rather than structural, factors, suggesting a shared formal core of music and language. I next review various animal communication systems that appear related to human music, either by analogy (bird and whale \"song\") or potential homology (great ape bimanual drumming). A crucial comparative distinction is between learned, complex signals (like language, music and birdsong) and unlearned signals (like laughter, ape calls, or bird calls). While human vocalizations clearly build upon an acoustic and emotional foundation shared with other primates and mammals, vocal learning has evolved independently in our species since our divergence with chimpanzees. The convergent evolution of vocal learning in other species offers a powerful window into psychological and neural constraints influencing the evolution of complex signaling systems (including both song and speech), while ape drumming presents a fascinating potential homology with human instrumental music. I next discuss the archeological data relevant to music evolution, concluding on the basis of prehistoric bone flutes that instrumental music is at least 40,000 years old, and perhaps much older. I end with a brief review of adaptive functions proposed for music, concluding that no one selective force (e.g., sexual selection) is adequate to explaining all aspects of human music. I suggest that questions about the past function of music are unlikely to be answered definitively and are thus a poor choice as a research focus for biomusicology. In contrast, a comparative approach to music promises rich dividends for our future understanding of the biology and evolution of music. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Chick-a-dee calls were recorded from Carolina chickadees in a naturalistic observation study in eastern Tennessee. Calls were analyzed using approaches from information theory, including transition probability matrices, Zipf’s rules, entropies, and information coding capacities of calls and notes of calls. As described for black-capped chickadees, calls of Carolina chickadees exhibited considerable structural complexity. Most results suggested that the call of Carolina chickadees is more structurally complex than that of black-capped chickadees.

  {"id":"garland_etal22","abstract":"Culture presents a second inheritance system by which innovations can be transmitted between generations and among individuals. Some vocal behaviours present compelling examples of cultural evolution. Where modifications accumulate over time, such a process can become cumulative cultural evolution. The existence of cumulative cultural evolution in non-human animals is controversial. When physical products of such a process do not exist, modifications may not be clearly visible over time. Here, we investigate whether the constantly evolving songs of humpback whales (\n              Megaptera novaeangliae\n              ) are indicative of cumulative cultural evolution. Using nine years of song data recorded from the New Caledonian humpback whale population, we quantified song evolution and complexity, and formally evaluated this process in light of criteria for cumulative cultural evolution. Song accumulates changes shown by an increase in complexity, but this process is punctuated by rapid loss of song material. While such changes tentatively satisfy the core criteria for cumulative cultural evolution, this claim hinges on the assumption that novel songs are preferred by females. While parsimonious, until such time as studies can link fitness benefits (reproductive success) to individual singers, any claims that humpback whale song evolution represents a form of cumulative cultural evolution may remain open to interpretation.\n            \n            This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Garland","given":"Ellen C."},{"family":"Garrigue","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Noad","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"garland_etal22","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

  {"id":"gilman_etal23","abstract":"Zipf’s law of abbreviation predicts that in human languages, words that are used more frequently will be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This has been attributed to the principle of least effort – communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipf’s law of abbreviation appears to hold for all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds for animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are less frequently used. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this analysis. We used ZLAvian to study Zipf’s law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found weak trends consistent with Zipf’s law of abbreviation in 10 of the 11 populations. Across all populations, the negative correlation between phrase length and frequency of use was several times weaker than the negative correlation between word length and frequency of use in human languages. This suggests that the mechanisms that underlie this correlation may be different in birdsong and human language.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilman","given":"R.

  {"id":"gruber_etal22","abstract":"Recent studies in several taxa have demonstrated that animal culture can evolve to become more efficient in various contexts ranging from tool use to route learning and migration. Under recent definitions, such increases in efficiency might satisfy the core criteria of cumulative cultural evolution (CCE). However, there is not yet a satisfying consensus on the precise definition of efficiency, CCE or the link between efficiency and more complex, extended forms of CCE considered uniquely human. To bring clarity to this wider discussion of CCE, we develop the concept of efficiency by (i) reviewing recent potential evidence for CCE in animals, and (ii) clarifying a useful definition of efficiency by synthesizing perspectives found within the literature, including animal studies and the wider iterated learning literature. Finally, (iii) we discuss what factors might impinge on the informational bottleneck of social transmission, and argue that this provides pressure for learnable behaviours across species. We conclude that framing CCE in terms of efficiency casts complexity in a new light, as learnable behaviours are a requirement for the evolution of complexity. Understanding how efficiency greases the ratchet of cumulative culture provides a better appreciation of how similar cultural evolution can be between taxonomically diverse species—a case for continuity across the animal kingdom.\n            This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gruber","given":"T."},{"family":"Chimento","given":"M."},{"family":"Aplin","given":"L.

  {"id":"hailman94","abstract":"Combinatorial calls of tits (Parus) resemble language in allowing the production of a huge variety of distinct call types based on combinations of a few note types. This study found a constrained type of permuted order of note types, which enlarges the potential for call variety and even more closely resembles properties of language. Vocalizations of the black-lored tit P. xanthogenys of India have never been studied in the wild and were known previously only through brief mention in two comparative reviews (Thielcke 1968, Hailman 1989). A wild-caught captive gave chick-a-dee-like calls in response to a stuffed owl. The tit used combinations of four note types (denoted A through D) to create 65 different call types. Zipf-Mandelbrot analysis showed that the repertoire of call types has the language-like property of \"openness\": as more calls are sampled, the number of call types represented in the sample continues to rise without bound. First-order Markov-chain analysis revealed that B, C and D notes tend to be isolated from one another, with A notes given between them, within strings of the same note-type, and at the beginning and ending of calls. This constrained permutation is missing from the merely combinatorial chick-a-dee calls of the black-capped chickadee P. atricapillus, where note-types occur in fixed order both within and among calls. Calling under constant stimulus conditions changed unidirectionally during the course of mobbing, with D notes first replacing B notes in calls and then also replacing C notes as time progressed. The evolution of note types and call structure is discussed in comparison with the black-capped chickadee.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hailman","given":"Jack P."}],"citation-key":"hailman94","container-title":"Bioacoustics","container-title-short":"Bioacoustics","DOI":"10.1080/09524622.1994.9753270","ISSN":"0952-4622, 2165-0586","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",1]]},"language":"en","page":"33-50","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Constrained permutation in \"chick-a-dee\"-like calls of a black-lored tit Parus xanthogenys","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09524622.1994.9753270","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"kanwal_etal17","abstract":"The linguist George Kingsley Zipf made a now classic observation about the relationship between a word’s length and its frequency; the more frequent a word is, the shorter it tends to be. He claimed that this ‘‘Law of Abbreviation” is a universal structural property of language. The Law of Abbreviation has since been documented in a wide range of human languages, and extended to animal communication systems and even computer programming languages. Zipf hypothesised that this universal design feature arises as a result of individuals optimising form-meaning mappings under competing pressures to communicate accurately but also efﬁciently—his famous Principle of Least Effort. In this study, we use a miniature artiﬁcial language learning paradigm to provide direct experimental evidence for this explanatory hypothesis. We show that language users optimise form-meaning mappings only when pressures for accuracy and efﬁciency both operate during a communicative task, supporting Zipf’s conjecture that the Principle of Least Effort can explain this universal feature of word length distributions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanwal","given":"Jasmeen"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kenny"},{"family":"Culbertson","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Kirby","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"kanwal_etal17","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2017.05.001","ISSN":"00100277","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8]]},"language":"en","page":"45-52","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zipf’s law of abbreviation and the principle of least effort: language users optimise a miniature lexicon for efficient communication","title-short":"Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation and the Principle of Least Effort","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027717301166","volume":"165"},

  {"id":"langfelder_etal08","abstract":"Summary: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible—cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein–protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Langfelder","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Horvath","given":"Steve"}],"citation-key":"langfelder_etal08","container-title":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btm563","ISSN":"1367-4811, 1367-4803","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"719-720","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Defining clusters from a hierarchical cluster tree: the Dynamic Tree Cut package for R","title-short":"Defining clusters from a hierarchical cluster tree","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/24/5/719/200751","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"lewis_etal23","abstract":"Abstract\n          \n            Linguistic laws, which describe common statistical patterns in human language, are often studied in animal communication systems. Despite good evidence for the existence of these laws in non-human primates, data is still limited for other taxa. Birdsong is often used as a model for human language development due to similarities in vocal learning and production. Therefore, it is useful to explore features of human language in birdsong to determine the value and limitations of such comparisons. Here, we looked for patterns consistent with Menzerath’s law, the tendency for longer sequences to be made up of smaller constituent parts, and Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation, the tendency for more frequently used elements to be shorter in length, in the songs of Java sparrows (\n            Padda oryzivora\n            ). We found that songs conformed to Menzerath’s law at both the population and individual level; longer sequences were made up of shorter notes, and this pattern was achieved through note selection, rather than shortening existing notes. This adherence to Menzerath’s law may reflect species-specific constraints on song durations. However, we found no evidence to support adherence to Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation, either at population or individual level; more frequently used notes were not shorter in length. As they are used in courtship, songs may experience different selection pressure to other parts of the vocal repertoire, which could act against compression. Whilst there may be some limitations in applying linguistic laws designed for human language to birdsong, especially Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation, these laws may still provide insights into animal and human communication systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lewis","given":"Rebecca N"},{"family":"Kwong","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Soma","given":"Masayo"},{"family":"De Kort","given":"Selvino R"},{"family":"Gilman","given":"R Tucker"}],"citation-key":"lewis_etal23","DOI":"10.1101/2023.12.13.571437","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Animal Behavior and Cognition","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Java sparrow song conforms to Menzerath’s Law but not Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2023.12.13.571437"},
  {"id":"liu_etal22","abstract":"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive cognitive disorder that occurs worldwide, and the lack of disease-modifying targets and pathways is a pressing issue. This study aimed to provide new targets and pathways by performing molecular subgroup classification. After normalizing the collected data, the subgroup number was confirmed with consensus clustering. Comparisons of clinical features among subgroups were conducted to clarify the clinical traits of each subgroup. Subgroup-specific genes were identified to perform weighted gene coexpression analysis (WGCNA). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were carried out. Next, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. Protein–protein interaction networks were built to screen core genes and in each subgroup to perform Spearman correlation analysis with clinical traits. Sequencing profiles of 1068 AD samples collected from 2 datasets were classified into 3 subgroups. Clinical comparisons revealed that patients in subgroup III tended to be younger, while their pathological grades were the most severe. WGCNA detected four gene modules, and the turquoise module, where the dopaminergic synapse pathway was enriched, was related to subgroup I. The neurotrophin signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway were robustly enriched in the blue and brown modules, respectively, in subgroup III. Moreover, 3 hub genes in subgroup I were negatively correlated with the sum of neurofibrillary tangle (Nft) density. Conversely, hub genes in subgroups II and III exhibited positive correlations with the sum of Nft density. These results provide new pathways and targets for AD treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Sha"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Deqin"}],"citation-key":"liu_etal22","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Mol Neurosci","DOI":"10.1007/s12031-021-01957-w","ISSN":"1559-1166","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"866-879","source":"Springer Link","title":"Molecular Subgroup Classification in Alzheimer’s Disease by Transcriptomic Profiles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-021-01957-w","volume":"72"},

Meningococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G (Pen I) carry a mutated penicillin-binding protein (PBP2) resulting in a modified peptidoglycan structure. Despite their antibiotic resistance, Pen I strains have failed to expand clonally. We analyzed the biological con-sequences of PBP2 alteration among clinical menin-gococcal strains and found that peptidoglycan modifications of the Pen I strain resulted in dimin-ished in vitro Nod1-dependent proinflammatory activity. In an influenza virus-meningococcal sequential mouse model mimicking human disease, wild-type meningococci induced a Nod1-dependent inflammatory response, colonizing the lungs and surviving in the blood. In contrast, isogenic Pen I strains were attenuated for such response and were out-competed by meningococci sensitive to penicillin G. Our results suggest that antibiotic resis-tance imposes a cost to the success of the pathogen and may potentially explain the lack of clonal expan-sion of Pen I strains.","author":[{"family":"Mennill","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Badyaev","given":"Alexander V."},{"family":"Jonart","given":"Leslie M."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Geoffrey E."}],"citation-key":"Mennill2006","container-title":"Ethology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01145.x","ISBN":"0179-1613","ISSN":"01791613","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"174-180","title":"Male house finches with elaborate songs have higher reproductive performance","type":"article-journal","volume":"112"},

A number of diversity indices have been proposed and used in numerous works in spite of a lack of statistical characteristics and tests of comparison. The relative abundance distribution can also be described using rank-frequency diagrams but ﬁtting these diagrams to mathematical models such as the Zipf-Mandelbrot model remains problematic. Strong correlation between the Zipf-Mandelbrot model parameters prevent their estimation by optimization algorithm. In light of this, new indices of sampled communities are introduced here. These indices are two linear regression slopes estimated from rank-frequency diagrams. The numerous statistical studies that have been carried out on linear regression models are used to compare sampled communities. These new indices possess characteristic properties with an ecological meaning. Correlations between these indices, the Zipf-Mandelbrot model parameters and an evenness diversity index are examined. An ecological application is made using entomological data as an example. This example consists of a transect from the edge of a pond to a dry forest along which 60,000 insects were sampled from six different sampling stations. Using the new indices described here, station C, located at the edge of that area subject to inﬂuence from the pond, is differentiated from the other stations. This station would seem to present the lowest degree of niche diversity and the lowest evenness, and recent observations conﬁrm the deterioration of this station.","author":[{"family":"Mouillot","given":"David"},{"family":"Lepretre","given":"Alain"}],"citation-key":"mouillot_lepretre00","container-title":"Environmental Monitoring and Assessment","DOI":"10.1023/A:1006297211561","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"en","page":"279-295","source":"Zotero","title":"Introduction of relative abundance distribution (RAD) indices, estimated from the rank-frequency diagrams (RFD), to assess changes in community diversity","type":"article-journal","volume":"63"},

We here tested a thrush nightingale's (Luscinia luscinia) rhythm, as represented by song amplitude envelope (containing information on note timing, duration, and intensity), for evidence of expressiveness. We used multifractal analysis, which is designed to detect in a signal dynamic fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable states on multiple timescales (e.g. notes, subphrases, songs). Results show that rhythm is strongly multifractal, indicating fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable patterns. Moreover, comparing original songs with re-synthesized songs that lack all subtle deviations from the \"standard\" note envelopes, we find that deviations in note intensity and duration significantly contributed to multifractality. This suggests that birdsong is more dynamic due to subtle note timing patterns, often similar to musical operations like accelerando or crescendo. While different sources of these dynamics are conceivable, this study shows that multi-timescale rhythm fluctuations can be detected in birdsong, paving the path to studying mechanisms and function behind such patterns.","author":[{"family":"Roeske","given":"Tina C."},{"family":"Kelty-Stephen","given":"Damian"},{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"roeske_etal18","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-018-22933-2","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-15","PMID":"29545558","publisher":"Springer US","title":"Multifractal analysis reveals music-like dynamic structure in songbird rhythms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22933-2","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"roeskeCategoricalRhythmsAre2020","abstract":"Rhythm is a prominent feature of music. Of the infinite possible ways of organizing events in time, musical rhythms are almost always distributed categorically. Such categories can facilitate the transmission of culture—a feature that songbirds and humans share. We compared rhythms of live performances of music to rhythms of wild thrush nightingale and domestic zebra finch songs. In nightingales, but not in zebra finches, we found universal rhythm categories, with patterns that were surprisingly similar to those of music. Isochronous 1:1 rhythms were similarly common. Interestingly, a bias toward small ratios (around 1:2 to 1:3), which is highly abundant in music, was observed also in thrush nightingale songs. Within that range, however, there was no statistically significant bias toward exact integer ratios (1:2 or 1:3) in the birds. High-ratio rhythms were abundant in the nightingale song and are structurally similar to fusion rhythms (ornaments) in music. In both species, preferred rhythms remained invariant over extended ranges of tempos, indicating natural categories. The number of rhythm categories decreased at higher tempos, with a threshold above which rhythm became highly stereotyped. In thrush nightingales, this threshold occurred at a tempo twice faster than in humans, indicating weaker structural constraints and a remarkable motor proficiency. Together, the results suggest that categorical rhythms reflect similar constraints on learning motor skills across species. The saliency of categorical rhythms across humans and thrush nightingales suggests that they promote, or emerge from, the cultural transmission of learned vocalizations.

  {"id":"rothenberg_etal14","abstract":"Songbirds spend much of their time learning, producing, and listening to complex vocal sequences we call songs. Songs are learned via cultural transmission, and singing, usually by males, has a strong impact on the behavioral state of the listeners, often promoting affiliation, pair bonding, or aggression. What is it in the acoustic structure of birdsong that makes it such a potent stimulus? We suggest that birdsong potency might be driven by principles similar to those that make music so effective in inducing emotional responses in humans: a combination of rhythms and pitches-and the transitions between acoustic states-affecting emotions through creating expectations, anticipations, tension, tension release, or surprise. Here we propose a framework for investigating how birdsong, like human music, employs the above \"musical\" features to affect the emotions of avian listeners. First we analyze songs of thrush nightingales (. Luscinia luscinia) by examining their trajectories in terms of transitions in rhythm and pitch. These transitions show gradual escalations and graceful modifications, which are comparable to some aspects of human musicality. We then explore the feasibility of stripping such putative musical features from the songs and testing how this might affect patterns of auditory responses, focusing on fMRI data in songbirds that demonstrate the feasibility of such approaches. Finally, we explore ideas for investigating whether musical features of birdsong activate avian brains and affect avian behavior in manners comparable to music's effects on humans. In conclusion, we suggest that birdsong research would benefit from current advances in music theory by attempting to identify structures that are designed to elicit listeners' emotions and then testing for such effects experimentally. Birdsong research that takes into account the striking complexity of song structure in light of its more immediate function - to affect behavioral state in listeners - could provide a useful animal model for studying basic principles of music neuroscience in a system that is very accessible for investigation, and where developmental auditory and social experience can be tightly controlled. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","author":[{"family":"Rothenberg","given":"David"},{"family":"Roeske","given":"Tina C."},{"family":"Voss","given":"Henning U."},{"family":"Naguib","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Tchernichovski","given":"Ofer"}],"citation-key":"rothenberg_etal14","container-title":"Hearing Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.heares.2013.08.016","ISSN":"18785891","issue":"September","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"71-83","PMID":"24036130","publisher":"Elsevier B.V","title":"Investigation of musicality in birdsong","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heares.2013.08.016","volume":"308"},

  {"id":"sinclair_etal22","abstract":"Culture can be deﬁned as “group typical behaviour patterns shared by members of a community that rely on socially learned and transmitted information” (Laland and Hoppitt, 2003, p. 151). Once thought to be a distinguishing characteristic of humans relative to other animals (Dean et al., 2014) it is now generally accepted to exist more widely, with especially abundant evidence in non-human primates, cetaceans, and birds (Rendell and Whitehead, 2001; Aplin, 2019; Whiten, 2021). More recently, cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) has taken on this distinguishing role (Henrich, 2015; Laland, 2018). CCE, it is argued, allows humans, uniquely, to ratchet up the complexity or efﬁciency of cultural traits over time. This “ratchet effect” (Tomasello, 1994) gives the capacity to accumulate beneﬁcial modiﬁcations over time beyond the capacities of a single individual (Sasaki and Biro, 2017). Mesoudi and Thornton (2018) deﬁne a core set of criteria for identifying CCE in humans and non-human animals that places emphasis on some performance measure of traits increasing over time. They suggest this emphasis is also pertinent to cultural products in the aesthetic domain, but is this the case? Music, art and dance evolve over time (Savage, 2019), but can we say they gain beneﬁcial modiﬁcations that increase their aesthetic value? Here we bring together perspectives from philosophy, musicology and biology to build a conceptual analysis of this question. We summarise current thinking on cumulative culture and aesthetics across ﬁelds to determine how aesthetic culture ﬁts into the concept of CCE. We argue that this concept is problematic to reconcile with dominant views of aesthetics in philosophical analysis and struggles to characterise aesthetic cultures that evolve over time. We suggest that a tension arises from fundamental differences between cultural evolution in aesthetic and technological domains. Furthermore, this tension contributes to current debates between reconstructive and preservative theories of cultural evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinclair","given":"Natalie C."},{"family":"Ursell","given":"James"},{"family":"South","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Rendell","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"sinclair_etal22","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"williamsCumulativeCulturalEvolution2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            Cumulative cultural evolution, the accumulation of sequential changes within a single socially learned behaviour that results in improved function, is prominent in humans and has been documented in experimental studies of captive animals and managed wild populations. Here, we provide evidence that cumulative cultural evolution has occurred in the learned songs of Savannah sparrows. In a first step, “click trains” replaced “high note clusters” over a period of three decades. We use mathematical modelling to show that this replacement is consistent with the action of selection, rather than drift or frequency-dependent bias. Generations later, young birds elaborated the “click train” song form by adding more clicks. We show that the new songs with more clicks elicit stronger behavioural responses from both males and females. Therefore, we suggest that a combination of social learning, innovation, and sexual selection favoring a specific discrete trait was followed by directional sexual selection that resulted in naturally occurring cumulative cultural evolution in the songs of this wild animal population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Scharf","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Ryba","given":"Anna R."},{"family":"Ryan Norris","given":"D."},{"family":"Mennill","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Newman","given":"Amy E.

  {"id":"zhao_etal20","abstract":"Objective: We aimed to screen the genes associated with thyroid cancer (THCA) prognosis, and construct a poly-gene risk prediction model for prognosis prediction and improvement.Methods: The HTSeq-Counts data of THCA were accessed from TCGA database, including 505 cancer samples and 57 normal tissue samples. “edgeR” package was utilized to perform differential analysis, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to screen the differential co-expression genes associated with THCA tissue types. Univariant Cox regression analysis was further used for the selection of survival-related genes. Then, LASSO regression model was constructed to analyze the genes, and an optimal prognostic model was developed as well as evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and ROC curves.Results: Three thousand two hundred seven differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by differential analysis and 23 co-expression genes (|COR| > 0.5, P < 0.05) were gained after WGCNA analysis. In addition, eight genes significantly related to THCA survival were screened by univariant Cox regression analysis, and an optimal prognostic 3-gene risk prediction model was constructed after genes were analyzed by the LASSO regression model. Based on this model, patients were grouped into the high-risk group and low-risk group. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that patients in the low-risk group had much better survival than those in the high-risk group. Moreover, great accuracy of the 3-gene model was revealed by ROC curve and the remarkable correlation between the model and patients' prognosis was verified using the multivariant Cox regression analysis.Conclusion: The prognostic 3-gene model composed by GHR, GPR125, and ATP2C2 three genes can be used as an independent prognostic factor and has better prediction for the survival of THCA patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Haiping"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shiwei"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Shijie"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Haixing"}],"citation-key":"zhao_etal20","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","ISSN":"1664-2392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Identification of a Prognostic 3-Gene Risk Prediction Model for Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00510","volume":"11"}
